# üîê Fullstack JWT Auth + RBAC: Spring Boot + MySQL + Docker

This project is a fullstack secure web application using:

- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java) with JWT authentication, refresh tokens, encryption API, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Database**: MySQL (local or Docker)
- **Security**: Password hashing, token revocation, rate limiting, AEAD encryption with IV
- **DevOps**: Docker support for both backend and frontend

---

## ‚úÖ Features

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- JWT access + refresh token
- Session management via client-side storage (localStorage)
- Token revocation and logout endpoint
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    - Admin and User roles
    - Promote/demote users with API
    - Role-based endpoint protection

### üîí Crypto API
- AES encryption/decryption
- AEAD mode with IV (CBC/GCM)
- Authenticated encryption
- Key/IV stored in H2 (or MySQL)
- Error handling and input validation

### üì¶ Dev Features
- Docker + Docker Compose support
- Environment-based configuration
- Rate limiting middleware
- Auto seed admin user (via `data.sql`)
- Postman collection for testing
